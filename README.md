# cs50-game (Defenitly not final)
#### Video Demo:  TODO
#### Disclosure:
To get a general idea of what I needed to learn to complete this project, I prompted ChatGPT to create project ideas and, after I chose from them my favorite, to create a roadmap for my project.
This was purely for the purpose of finding ideas, I don't want to use AI for solving concret programming problems.
#### Description:
My final project for CS50: A puzzle platformer (maybe)  
(TODO)
